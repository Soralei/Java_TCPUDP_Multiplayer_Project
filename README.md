# Java_TCPUDP_Multiplayer_Project

A multiplayer project with Java using sockets. Allows clients to connect to a server and syncs movement. Makes use of UDP for movement and TCP for critical network actions.

The MainTest.java demonstrates its usage by initiating the server. Test clients can be spawned from the server by pressing space bar. Clients can move around using WASDA.
